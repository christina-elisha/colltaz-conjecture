computational proof of colltaz conjecture

Colltaz Conjecture(1937) proposes this: any positive number following the transformation rule will eventually go to 1.
if (number is even) number /= 2
else number = number*3 + 1

/*
  it has been shown in computation that colltaz conjecture holds for number 10^20.
*/

do 
 
 if (nnnnnnnnn is even) {
   nnnnnnnnnn /= 2 
   }
 else {   
    let sum = 0;
    array.forEach(element => {
            element = element * 3 + 1;
            sum += element;
    });
   nnnnnnnn = sum;
  }
while (nnnnnnnnn <> 1)

prove the while block terminate for large numbers.
study the sequence.

is the sequence go down eventually?
when nnnnnn is even, sequence goes down by nnnnnn/2
when nnnnnn is odd, sequence pattern seems not straight. it goes up wildly.
prove it will eventually go under nnnnnn will prove Colltaz conjecture.
